# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
  The main purpose behind this project is to help Bobby to prove his proficiency in using SQL to his manager and provide detailed and correlated data about the number of retiring employees per title and the number of employees who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program at Pewlett Hackard company. 
## Results
  SQL has paved the way in front of Bobby and me to play with the data and extract the best analysis in a short period of time. The following four points explain the results of our analysis:
   - In the Retirement Titles CSV file, we see that the total number of employees who are counted for the retirement analysis is 133,776 which is considerably huge. However, duplicated employees exist due to the many titles for each employee. In this case, this table cannot be taken into consideration in our analysis.

   - The number of employees that are going to be counted in the retirement analysis has decreased from 133,776 to 90,398 employee after removing the duplicated employees numbers due to the multiple promotions for each employee in our data. This way has saved more than one third of the total number and helped in getting exact numbers.

   - The largest two titles in the retiring schedule are the senior engineers and senior staffs with the number 29,424 and 28,254, respectively, as we see below. This explains that the managment should expect a very high amount of retirement budget due to the retirement of high position employees.

   - Finally, the last table below shows that 1,549 employees are eligible to participate in the mentorship program using their birthdates criteria in the year 1965. This means that the management should compare this amount with the large amount of employees and see if the number of new mentors is enough.

## Summary
  In brief, Pewlett Hackard should start thinking about how it should cover all the 90,398 employees who are going to retire soon. This means that the company has to start planning on how to fill these roles as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact. As we discussed before, the number of senior retirees is almost two thirds of the total number of retirees, so the company has enough qualified, retirement-ready employees from the sernior engineers and staffs in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.
